# Client version of the Chat web-app

The client version of the app was migrated from create-react-app to the latest version of [Vite](https://vite.dev/), as it's one of the most recommended bundler to use nowadays, in this case, with React. [CRA is no longer supported](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/13072) and it's been deprecated since 2022.
